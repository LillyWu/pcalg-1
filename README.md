This algorithm is logically translated from the R package: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/pcalg/versions/2.6-0
The original algorithm was implemented by Kalisch, M., Mächler, M., Colombo, D., Maathuis, M. H., & Bühlmann, P. (2012). Causal inference using graphical models with the R package pcalg. Journal of Statistical Software, 47(11), 1-26.
